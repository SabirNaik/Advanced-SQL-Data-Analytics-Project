# Advanced-SQL-Data-Analytics-Project

Personal Project â€¢ [Jan 2024]
Technologies: SQL (PostgreSQL]

Overview: Developed an end-to-end SQL project to perform advanced data analytics on a music/invoice dataset. The project involved designing queries to extract insights about employee hierarchy, invoice distributions, customer spending, and genre popularity.

Key Achievements:
Senior Employee Identification: Wrote queries to determine the senior-most employee based on job titles using an ORDER BY levels DESC LIMIT 1 approach.

Invoice Analysis: Created aggregations to find which countries had the most invoices and calculated top invoice values.

Customer Insights: Joined multiple tables to identify top spending customers and analyze purchase trends using CTEs and window functions.

Advanced Analytics: Employed CTEs to determine best-selling artists and the most popular genres per country, demonstrating the use of window functions and grouping.

Impact: Improved data retrieval efficiency and provided actionable business insights by automating complex queries and analysis.
